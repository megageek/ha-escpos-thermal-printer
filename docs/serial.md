# Serial (UART/RS-232) Printers

For printers connected via a physical serial cable or a network-based serial proxy such as ESPHome.

The integration supports four connection formats:

| Format | Example | Use case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Device path | `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyACM0`, `COM3` | Direct UART/RS-232 cable |
| `esphome://host:port` | `esphome://192.168.1.100:6638` | ESPHome UART proxy |
| `rfc2217://host:port` | `rfc2217://192.168.1.50:2217` | RFC 2217 serial server |
| `socket://host:port` | `socket://192.168.1.50:9100` | Raw TCP socket |

## Requirements

- **Direct serial (device path):** The Home Assistant host must have a serial port accessible at the path (USB-to-serial adapters show up as `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux).
- **Serial port permissions on Linux:** The HA user must be in the `dialout` group (or `uucp` on some distributions):
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG dialout homeassistant
  ```
  Log out and back in (or restart HA) for the group change to take effect.
- **Docker:** Pass the serial device through to the container:
  ```yaml
  services:
    homeassistant:
      devices:
        - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
  ```
- **Network-based connections (ESPHome, RFC2217, socket):** No special permissions needed — the integration connects over TCP.

## Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Serial port | Device path (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`) or URL (e.g. `esphome://host:port`) | — |
| Baud rate | Serial speed for direct connections. Ignored for URL-based connections. | 9600 |
| Timeout | Connection timeout in seconds | 4.0 |
| Printer Profile | Your printer model (or Auto-detect) | Auto-detect |
| Codepage | Character encoding (or Auto-detect) | Auto-detect |
| Line width | Characters per line (32 for 58 mm, 42–48 for 80 mm) | 48 |

## ESPHome serial proxy

The most common networked-serial use case: an ESP32/ESP8266 bridging a UART-connected printer to your network. Add a `uart:` block and a `uart_switch:` (or equivalent ESPHome UART proxy component) to your device's YAML, then use the ESPHome URL format as the serial port.

### Example ESPHome configuration

```yaml
uart:
  id: printer_uart
  tx_pin: GPIO17
  rx_pin: GPIO16
  baud_rate: 9600

uart_switch:
  uart_id: printer_uart
  port: 6638
```

### Connecting in HA

In the serial port field, enter:

```
esphome://192.168.1.100:6638
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with the ESP device's IP and `6638` with the port you configured. The **baud rate** setting in HA is ignored for ESPHome URLs — the speed is set on the ESP side in the `uart:` block.

### Write chunk size and inter-chunk delay

ESP32 UART FIFOs are small (128 bytes). When the integration sends a large print job the ESP32 can drop bytes if data arrives faster than it can drain the buffer, causing garbled or truncated output.

To work around this, set the **Write chunk size** and **Inter-chunk delay** options in the integration's settings:

| Option | Recommended value | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Write chunk size | `128` | Maximum bytes sent per write call |
| Inter-chunk delay (ms) | `10` | Pause between chunks so the device can drain its buffer |

These options are available under **Settings → Devices & services → ESC/POS Thermal Printer → Configure**.

## Direct UART / RS-232

For printers with a physical RS-232 or TTL serial port connected directly to the HA host (or via a USB-to-serial adapter):

1. Find the port path:
   ```bash
   ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
   # or, for a more descriptive listing:
   ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
   ```
2. Find the right baud rate — check your printer's manual or print a self-test page (hold the feed button while powering on). Common rates: 9600, 19200, 38400, 115200.
3. In the integration setup, enter the device path (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`) and select the baud rate.

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied accessing serial port"

The HA process can't open the device node. On Linux, add the HA user to the `dialout` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout homeassistant
```

Restart Home Assistant for the change to take effect.

### "Serial port not found"

The device path doesn't exist on the host. Verify with:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
```

For URL-based connections, confirm the ESPHome device / RFC2217 server is online and reachable.

### "Serial port is busy"

Another process holds the port. Common culprits on Linux are **ModemManager** and **brltty** (Braille TTY), which claim USB-serial adapters automatically:

```bash
# Disable ModemManager (if not needed)
sudo systemctl disable --now ModemManager

# Or tell udev to ignore the device:
# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-escpos-serial.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="<VID>", ATTRS{idProduct}=="<PID>", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
```

### Garbled or truncated output (ESPHome/ESP32)

The ESP32 is dropping bytes due to UART buffer overruns. Enable write chunking — see [Write chunk size and inter-chunk delay](#write-chunk-size-and-inter-chunk-delay) above.

### Status shows "Unknown" until first print

The binary sensor for serial printers works by checking whether the device path exists and is a character device. For URL-based connections (ESPHome, RFC2217) it makes a brief test connection. If **Status check interval** is `0` (the default), no periodic check runs and the status remains unknown until something is printed. Set **Status check interval** to a non-zero value (e.g. 60 seconds) to enable periodic checks.
