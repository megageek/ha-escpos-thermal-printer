# ESC/POS Thermal Printer for Home Assistant

Native Home Assistant control for ESC/POS thermal receipt printers connected via **Network (TCP/IP)**, **USB**, **Bluetooth**, or **Serial (UART/RS-232)**.

- **Print services** — text (raw + UTF-8 transcoding), QR codes, barcodes, images, and free-form messages
- **Control services** — paper feed, partial/full cut, beeper
- **Notification platform** — pipe HA notifications straight to a printer
- **Status binary sensor** — reachability check works for network, USB, Bluetooth, and serial
- **Battery sensor** — reports battery level for portable BT printers that expose `org.bluez.Battery1`
- **Auto-discovery** — USB printers matched against known thermal-printer vendor IDs
- **Local push** — no cloud, no account

## Setup

After install, restart Home Assistant and add the integration from **Settings → Devices & Services**. Pick your connection type (Network, USB, Bluetooth, or Serial) and follow the prompts.

**Bluetooth users**: pair the printer on the host (e.g. via `bluetoothctl pair AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`) **before** adding the integration. The integration does not initiate pairing itself.

**Serial users**: on Linux, add the HA user to the `dialout` group (`sudo usermod -aG dialout homeassistant`). ESPHome serial proxies are supported using `esphome://host:port` as the port.
